#Welcome to _SpoilerAlert!_
_Created by the Fat Arrow Faction team as part of the School of Code._

Our app helps users manage their food inventory by allowing them to input food items manually or by scanning receipts with OCR technology.

##Current Features:

1. Individual users recieve metrics on their food wastage and usage over time, as a percentage of use and cost value, all time and for current week.
2. Visible queues on when items are expired or approaching expiry
3. Input food items in bulk using OCR technology, by taking an image of a receipt, or food items with clearly visible labels
4. Input food items manually
5. Provide an ordered list by expiry date, or expired.

##Roadmap:

1. Add social aspects so users, particularly those sharing households, can communicate in-app
2. Add multiple food storage options within one household, for example, fridge, freezer, cupboard; changing expiry dates as moved.
3. Allow users, such as carers looking after multiple people, to access multiple houses
4. Auto-populate shopping lists based off of expired and used food; offer suggestions based on wastage
5. Donate food approaching expiry dates; join with another app [] via API to find closest foodbanks/organisations accepting donations via a map.
6. Generate recipes based off of items approaching expiry
7. Purchase your shopping list via partnered food delivery service providers.
