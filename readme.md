Welcome to the SpoilerAlert! App, created by the Fat Arrow Faction team as part of the School of Code. Our app helps users manage their food inventory by allowing them to input food items manually or by scanning receipts with OCR technology.

With our app, users can track their food wastage and usage over time, both as a percentage and as a cost value. They will also receive warnings when items are nearly expired or have expired.
Our stretch goals include adding social aspects to talk to other users, adding multiple food storage items within the same house, allowing users to log into multiple houses, auto-populating shopping lists, donating food to nearby food banks with a map function for the closest organization accepting donations, generating recipes based off of items nearly out of date, and even purchasing through other shopping applications.

The Fat Arrow Faction team members are:

- Mike Chara
- Mohamed Abdi
- Chris Sanger
- Arooj Ilyas
- Nicholas Pervez

Thank you for choosing our app to help you manage your food inventory! We're hoping to make an impact on the global costs of food waste, both social and ecological.
