# Welcome to _SpoilerAlert!_

## _Created by the Fat Arrow Faction team as part of the School of Code._

Our app helps users manage their food inventory by allowing them to input food items manually or by scanning receipts with OCR technology.

## Current Features:

- Individual users recieve metrics on their food wastage and usage over time, as a percentage of use and cost value, all time and for current week.
- Visible queues on when items are expired or approaching expiry
- Input food items in bulk using OCR technology, by taking an image of a receipt, or food items with clearly visible labels
- Input food items manually
- Provide an ordered list by expiry date, or expired.

## Roadmap:

- Add social aspects so users, particularly those sharing households, can communicate in-app
- Add multiple food storage options within one household, for example, fridge, freezer, cupboard; changing expiry dates as moved.
- Allow users, such as carers looking after multiple people, to access multiple houses
- Auto-populate shopping lists based off of expired and used food; offer suggestions based on wastage
- Donate food approaching expiry dates; join with another app [] via API to find closest foodbanks/organisations accepting donations via a map.
- Generate recipes based off of items approaching expiry
- Purchase your shopping list via partnered food delivery service providers.
